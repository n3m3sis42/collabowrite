# collabowrite
A place for writers of all stripes to create, brainstorm and grow their stories

With this project, I hope to incorporate elements of two previous projects I worked on:
https://github.com/n3m3sis42/story-board-client-v2
https://github.com/tsengsational/story-jam-client

As a coder and a writer, I'm hoping to build a web app that will help people like me brainstorm their ideas, plan their stories, and organize their thoughts, plots, and other random information that comes with nurturing characters and worlds. My goal is to add in websockets to make all aspects of this app fully collaborative in real time, but that will come later. 

If you are interested in this project, please feel free to contact me with suggestions. :)
