# collabowrite
A place for writers of all stripes to create, brainstorm and grow their stories

With this project, I hope to incorporate elements of two previous projects I worked on:
https://github.com/n3m3sis42/story-board-client-v2
https://github.com/tsengsational/story-jam-client

As a coder, a writer and a lover of Literature and Latte's Scrivener desktop app, I'm hoping to build something that will help people like me organize their thoughts, their plots, and the profusion of random information that comes with nurturing characters and worlds. My goal is to add in websockets to make all aspects of this app fully collaborative in real time, but that will come later. 

If you are interested in this project, please feel free to contact me with suggestions. :)
